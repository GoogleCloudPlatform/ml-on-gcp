    "## What are they good for?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Wrapping your model up in an Estimator gives you off-the-shelf [between-graph replication](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/how_tos/distributed/#replicated_training) for your training jobs through [Experiment](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/learn/Experiment) (which encapsulates the process of training a model) and [learn_runner](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/contrib/learn/learn_runner/run) (which actually handles the replication). This makes it particularly easy to take advantage of the scaling functionality on [Cloud Machine Learning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/ml-engine), for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the Estimator interface makes it easy to save and restore your trained models, which has generally been something of a stumbling block when it comes to using TensorFlow.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. TensorFlow has a number of canned Estimators -- [LinearClassifier](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/LinearClassifier), [LinearRegressor](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/LinearRegressor), [DNNClassifier](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/DNNClassifier), [DNNRegressor](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/DNNRegressor), [DNNLinearCombinedClassifier](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/DNNLinearCombinedClassifier), [DNNLinearCombinedRegressor](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/estimator/DNNLinearCombinedRegressor). Moreover, it is recommended that model definitions be wrapped up inside estimators. This means that more and more people are going to be using estimators. Defining your models within Estimators allow them to be dropped in with minimal fuss in place of existing Estimators within particular workflows. This allows not just you, but all potential users of your estimator to iterate painlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If you are interested in (eventually) training your model on [TPUs](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/05/an-in-depth-look-at-googles-first-tensor-processing-unit-tpu), wrapping it in an Estimator will go very far towards making sure that it is truly leveraging the power of the TPU. This is because TensorFlow uses the interface to determine optimal placement of operations on devices."

However, we will also be using some utilities that make it easier to work with estimators (like experiments), which have not yet been ported over to the `tf.estimator` module. This will require some rather hacky modifications to certain `tf.contrib.learn` concepts. As TensorFlow improves the situation with `tf.estimator`, we will reflect those changes here."
